# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
- It took me about 12 hours
## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
- The most satisfied part is the search function. Now I can apply it to my web project

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
- That is the GUI part. The styling is really hard to control. I prefer styling with CSS. It is much more easier

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
- The search part, I really like it.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
- The next time I will plan the time more effectively. This project costs more than than I have expected.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
- I just use the lecture materials and from what I have learn from javascript (my major language), I search for the similar methods in python.


## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
- The main challange is kivy. Its documentation is one of the most complicated ever. I have a tough time reading them.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
- It's fantastic for OOP, maybe a life changer.
